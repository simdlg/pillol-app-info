## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

**Pillol App** is a personal project developed to help users remember to take their medicines.  

After careful consideration, I decided not to publish or distribute this app due to concerns about its potential safety-critical nature and to avoid any risk of harm. As such, it will remain a personal, non-public project. 

## ‚ú® Features implemented

- Add and manage medications
- Set recurring schedules
- Receive notifications as reminders
- Track which doses were taken  

The app stores all data locally on the user's device using an internal database. The only permission required is for sending notifications.
